# Customer_Churn_Analysis_Project
Hello!

This was my first hands-on coding project using Python and pandas. 
I explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset to understand how customer behavior translates into business outcomes. 

## Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess messy data
- Visualize patterns in customer churn
- Prepare features for deeper analysis
- Connect technical tools with business questions

It was my introduction to thinking analytically with data — cleaning messy columns, visualizing patterns, and preparing features for deeper analysis.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

- **Senior Citizens** show a higher churn rate compared to younger customers.
- **Month-to-month contracts** are strongly associated with churn, especially when combined with no internet service.
- Customers with **fiber optic internet** and **no online security** are more likely to leave.
- **Tenure and total charges** are strong indicators of loyalty — long-term customers tend to stay.
- **Payment method** matters: churn is higher among customers using electronic checks.

These insights help identify at-risk customer segments and guide retention strategies.


I'm an MBA postgrad transitioning into data analytics, and this project really helped me connect technical tools with business questions. It taught me how to ask better questions, spot trends, and build the foundation for predictive modeling. 

I'm continuing to build skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI, with the goal of applying analytics to solve real-world problems in business.
