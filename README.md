# Customer_Churn_Analysis_Project
Helloo!

This was my first hands-on coding project using Python and pandas. 
I explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset to understand how customer behavior translates into business outcomes. 

It was my introduction to thinking analytically with data — cleaning messy columns, visualizing patterns, and preparing features for deeper analysis.

As an MBA postgrad transitioning into data analytics, this project helped me connect technical tools with business questions. It taught me how to ask better questions, spot trends, and build the foundation for predictive modeling. 

I'm continuing to build skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI, with the goal of applying analytics to solve real-world problems in business.
